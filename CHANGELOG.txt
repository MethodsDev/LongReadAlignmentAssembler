v0.15.0, December 14, 2025
- using 90th percentile for trimming non-TSS and non-PolyA termini based on read boundaries


v0.14.0, December 6, 2025
- in HiFi mode, only retain single-exon transcripts if they have TSS or PolyA annotated
- incorporating filtering of good cells via DropletUtils and revised sparse matrices limited to good cells, and made filtering good cells optional
- support quant-only mode for the single cell workflow
- CAS integration as plugin for cell type annotations
- bugfix for DTU anlysis taking into account cell fractions: enforce the min cell fraction requirement on the higher delta pi value cluster for the isoform. Also, if excluding unspliced, remove them from contributing to the isoform fraction dataframe too
- include the umap and seurat objects as wdl outputs in the single cell pipe
- under LRAA merge mode, report problematic transcripts that dont have paths in the splice graph, no longer a fatal error.


v0.13.0, November 23, 2025
- restructured WDLs for single cell pipeline, introducing 'basic' vs. 'cluster-guided' modes, removed the --bam_list from LRAA and relying on wdl pipe for orchestration of cluster-based quants
- improved logging and mulithreading in workflows


v0.12.7, November 18, 2025
- merge_LRAA script allows for alternative backends but defaults to in-memory
- bugfix: MultiPath assumed every read name could be resolved to a compact ID via READ_NAME_STORE. On Terra’s merge job that store failed to initialize, so the fake provenance names for input transcripts never mapped to IDs, _read_count stayed zero, and MultiPathCounter.add tripped assert multipath_obj.get_read_count() > 0. We hardened MultiPath to fall back to deterministic hash-based IDs when the store is unavailable and to seed the count from the provided read_names, so the counter always sees a positive weight even in store-less merge mode.
- added wdl progress monitoring to cell cluster-guided lraa
- allow for gene_id and transcript_id in ref_gtf to be separated by other metadata
- sparse matrix builder - updating to avoid the segfault pandas bug, use python engine


v0.12.0, November 14, 2025
- caching initially constructed splice graphs for reuse in downstream quants to avoid reconstruction effort.
- all splice graphs for all steps leverage the normalized read coverage (not just isoform ID)
- added --num_parallel_contigs to control contig-level concurrency (default 4 workers); --num_threads_per_worker (legacy --CPU alias) specifies cores allocated per contig/strand worker (default 1 core)
- default --oversimplify now targets mitochondrial contigs ("chrM,M")
- wdls optimized for splitting data per chromosome
- scatter runs per chromosome only (strand-level splitting removed) with subjobs shuffled for improved load balancing
- including ref-annot gene symbol integration into single cell pipeline


v0.11.0, November 10, 2025
- LRAA wdls to scatter over the chromosome/strand combo
- improved multithreading within contigs
- more logging and progress monitoring for long running parts
- using Leiden alg for isoform-to-gene clustering and adjustments for large clusters to avoid runtime performance issues
- added --verbose to force direct logging to the terminal. When running in default parallel contig mode, all logging info is written to the corresponding chr/strand err log

    
v0.10.0 November 2, 2025
- Defaults now tuned for non-HiFi long reads (e.g., ONT). Replaced --LowFi flag with --HiFi to enable more stringent PacBio HiFi parameters.
- HiFi mode sets: min_per_id=98, infer_TSS/PolyA enabled, max_exon_spur_length=13, no splice-boundary aggregation, and fractures splice graph at input transcript bounds.
- runs --CPU parallel contig/strand combinations. If --no_parallelize_contigs, then allows up to --CPU per cluster of reads in per contig/strand evals.
- can resume from earlier partially completed runs.  Disable with  --no_resume_parallel
- uses SQLITE (or lmdb) where needed to reduce RAM usage.  See --store_backend
- new --bam_list option intended for quant-only runs with single cell cluster data, each bam corresponding to the cell cluster partitioned bam. Used in single cell pipeline (WDL).
