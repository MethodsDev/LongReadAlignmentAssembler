v0.2.9
- made aggressive read assignment a configurable parameter
- skip genes w/o read support
- adding test for expr corr w/ and w/o EM
- blackened all pylib
- adjusting TSS and PolyA for input_transcripts based on dist/2

v0.2.8
- split parallelization targeting larger components to separate threads while the main process quickly handles the smaller ones directly.
- wdl updates exposing more input parameters
- refactoring of Quant module, running EM on per-gene basis instead of per-contig, separate EM max iterations for quant vs. asm
- refactoring of transcript isoform filtering methods into TranscriptFiltering module.

v0.2.7
- pruning low supported introns within exon islands and aggregating for splice dist for low qual alignments

v0.2.6
- during assembly mode, including input transcripts as substrates for path nodes instead of just for the splice graph construction

v0.2.5
- EM on by default (use --no_EM to disable)
