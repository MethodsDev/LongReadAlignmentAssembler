v0.2.17
- incorporated FSM compatibility into read assignment logic cascade.


v0.2.16
- wdls greatly simplified.
- after initial asm, doing quant based on all reads not just the norm reads


v0.2.15
- altered handling of input ref trans in genome annot guided mode. Added CLI option: --ref_trans_filter_mode, default:  retain_expressed

v0.2.14
- incorporated CGPT implementation of EM as default and alternative to the BJH implementation. Can be set via CLI --EM_implementation

v0.2.13
- major refactoring of the EM code

v0.2.11
- redo read weighting, restrict to initial M step.

v0.2.10
- dont aggregate small splice dist if alt intron is a ref intron
- computing multipath transcript compatibility weights based on distance to termini
- restructuring quant in assembly step to access mp_counter
- included option --no_use_weighted_read_assignments to restore earlier behavior

v0.2.9
- made aggressive read assignment a configurable parameter
- skip genes w/o read support
- adding test for expr corr w/ and w/o EM
- blackened all pylib
- adjusting TSS and PolyA for input_transcripts based on dist/2

v0.2.8
- split parallelization targeting larger components to separate threads while the main process quickly handles the smaller ones directly.
- wdl updates exposing more input parameters
- refactoring of Quant module, running EM on per-gene basis instead of per-contig, separate EM max iterations for quant vs. asm
- refactoring of transcript isoform filtering methods into TranscriptFiltering module.

v0.2.7
- pruning low supported introns within exon islands and aggregating for splice dist for low qual alignments

v0.2.6
- during assembly mode, including input transcripts as substrates for path nodes instead of just for the splice graph construction

v0.2.5
- EM on by default (use --no_EM to disable)
